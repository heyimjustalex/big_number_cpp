# big_number_cpp
It's a university project, which was about creating a calculator to add and subtract numbers of any length. It was supposed to be written without using STL, strings or vector. Just pure char arr and algorithmical operations. 

Uses "windows.h" to clear console (delete "System("cls") if compliling on Linux).
